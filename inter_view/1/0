0.  AWS
I have used Amazon Web Services primarily for business purposes
- setting up Virtual Private Clouds with autosacling and load balancing for scalable and relibile infrastucture

- API Gateway and Lambda (is a serverless compute service that runs code in response to events)
-- For example, I have used API Gateway to create secure, scalable APIs as part of serverless architectures.
API Gateway routes requests to Lambda, allowing me to handle event-driven tasks without managing servers.
-- the SNS service acted as a trigger for Lambda functions(there some task thar were pushed into sns service)

- Terraform and CloudFormation
I haven’t used Terraform in production, but I have received hands-on experience with AWS CloudFormation,
which is a similar IaC tool. The main difference is that CloudFormation uses a different syntax,
but the goal is the same: automated management AWS resources.
## I have worked with Terraform for self-education purposes to understand Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) principles.

- monitoring
- Yes, of course, when I developed my app, errers were collected in cloudwatch for resolving them in future,
allowing us to troubleshoot and optimize application performance.
- in another case when I build pipelines and collected some statics into CloudWatch service for vizualization it in Grafana

- RDS (RDS automates backups, scaling, and security.)
In my previous project, the DevOps team handled RDS by setting it up on EC2 instances and providing access credentials for our team

- S3:
I have used S3 for object storage, managing file uploads, backups, and archiving data.
S3 is scalable service which ideal for handling large amounts of data in a cost-effective way.

1. Understanding of EHR technologies such as EPIC, Cerner, etc…
I dont have direct expirince in EHR such as EPIC and Cerner, but I'm eager to learn more about it

I haven’t used DICOM  and HL7/FHIR in practice.
DICOM – used for handling static data like medical images.
HL7/FHIR – dynamic standards for exchanging medical data

2. CI/CD
I used to work with GitActions to intigrate my code at various stages of development. This included running tests, linting, and deploying code to different environments
In my previous project DevOps team handled CD by utilizing autoscaling and loadbalancing services within amazon VPC(ви-пи-си)

3.Python/Powershell
-- I'm highly proficient in python and can automate almost all bisness logic what u need.
----- automate data processing tasks,
----- integrate with APIs,
----- and handle cloud services
-- Powershell is envirment  where u can run commands to automate  bussnes  logic

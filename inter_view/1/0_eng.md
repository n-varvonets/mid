# Вопросы и ответы для HR-интервью

## 1. Расскажите о себе.
I am 28 years old and live in Odessa. From a young age, I was interested in computers and loved exploring settings in video games. One day, I played against game developers in Tanks and won. I thought I was skilled, but I soon realized that the developers were the real experts. This inspired me to learn more about IT. Over time, I have developed my skills in programming, data management, and automation. Now I have several years of experience working with Python, databases, and large data systems.

## 2. Какой ваш самый лучший проект и почему?
One of my best projects was at DataForest, where I integrated Elasticsearch to improve the speed and efficiency of data searches in a large system. This project stood out because it significantly enhanced the performance of the platform, allowing users to process large amounts of data faster. Additionally, I optimized asynchronous data processing using AWS, which made the system more scalable. This project helped me grow my skills in handling large datasets and building robust backend solutions.

## 3. Какие навыки вы использовали в вашем последнем проекте?
In my last project, I used Python and Django REST Framework to manage APIs and large data. I also worked with Elasticsearch to improve data search performance, and AWS Lambda for asynchronous data processing. On the backend side, I used PostgreSQL for database management, focusing on optimizing queries and improving overall performance.

## 3.1. с какими технолгиями работали в последнее время и что изучали?
- Recently, I have been working extensively with Python, Django REST Framework (DRF), PostgreSQL, and AWS. In my current role, I focus on handling large datasets, integrating Elasticsearch for better performance, and using AWS Lambda for asynchronous data processing. I’ve also worked with tools like Redis for caching and Selenium for test automation.
- As for learning, I’ve been focusing on deepening my knowledge of algorithms and data structures. I’ve also started exploring cloud technologies more deeply, especially AWS services like CloudWatch and Lambda. Additionally, I am interested in improving my skills in system design and architecture to build more scalable and efficient applications.

## 4. Как вы справляетесь с дедлайнами?
I prioritize tasks by their importance and break down larger tasks into smaller, manageable steps. I always set clear milestones for myself to track progress. If I encounter an issue, I communicate with my team early to resolve it efficiently and avoid delays. This approach helps me stay organized and meet deadlines consistently.

## 5. Расскажите о том, как вы решали сложную проблему на работе.
At 1000GEEKS, we had a challenge with processing large volumes of data quickly and efficiently. I implemented asynchronous methods using Python, which allowed the system to process multiple tasks simultaneously. I also optimized database queries and integrated Redis caching, which resulted in a significant improvement in data processing speed. This experience taught me how to balance performance with reliability.

## 6. Как вы работаете в команде?
I value open communication and collaboration in a team. I believe that sharing knowledge and discussing ideas leads to better solutions. I always try to support my colleagues, whether by reviewing code, offering suggestions, or helping troubleshoot problems. At the same time, I appreciate constructive feedback, as it helps me grow and improve my work.

## 7. Почему вы выбрали именно эту профессию?
I chose IT because I enjoy problem-solving and building systems that make things work more efficiently. The challenge of continuously learning and applying new technologies keeps me motivated. I find it very rewarding to see how my work impacts users and improves the performance of applications.

## 8. Какие у вас планы на будущее?
My goal is to continue growing in backend development, particularly focusing on algorithms, data structures, and system architecture. I am also interested in exploring more about cloud technologies and distributed systems. In the long term, I would like to lead larger projects and mentor junior developers, helping them grow in their careers.

## 9. Что вас мотивирует в работе?
I am motivated by the opportunity to solve complex problems and create solutions that have a real impact on users. I enjoy seeing how my work can improve system performance or make a product more user-friendly. Learning new technologies and applying them to real-world scenarios also keeps me inspired.

## 10. Как вы справляетесь с конфликтами в команде?
If there is a conflict in the team, I try to approach it calmly and objectively. I believe it's important to listen to all sides and understand their perspectives. After that, I focus on finding a solution that works for everyone and aligns with the team's goals. Clear communication and mutual respect are key to resolving conflicts effectively.

## 11. What is your expected salary?
May I ask, what is the salary range you have in mind for this position? I’m flexible regarding the salary and open to discussing it based on the responsibilities and expectations of the role.

## 12. HR: Do you have experience with FastAPI?
Ты: I haven’t worked directly with FastAPI, but I have significant experience with Django REST Framework (DRF). Both are web frameworks in Python, and they share many similar concepts, such as handling APIs, request/response cycles, and authentication. I am confident that my experience with DRF would help me quickly adapt to working with FastAPI if needed.

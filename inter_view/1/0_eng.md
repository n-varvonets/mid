## 1. Расскажите о себе.

I am 28 years old and live in Odessa. I have been in IT for almost 4 years. Python is my main language, and I've worked
with AWS and NoSQL databases like Elasticsearch. I have experience with big data, optimizing them, and using AWS for
asynchronous processing.

## 2. Опыт работы.

- Worked with Elasticsearch to manage large and unstructured datasets.
- Used AWS Lambda as a function to populate Elasticsearch with valuable data using SNS and Dead Letter Queue (DLQ). This
  pipeline is still running.
- Added a new subscription system for new users while keeping the old one for existing users by using the Factory
  pattern.
- Integrated various system to previous projects.

- Handled a business task to find the most frequently used words in a system for potential patenting. Initially, the
  process was written synchronously, which took 50 hours. After refactoring, I reduced the processing time to 2.5 hours,
  speeding it up by 25 times. This made both me and the client very happy.
- Worked with Django REST Framework (DRF), PostgREST for API management and data processing.
- Optimized PostgreSQL databases by adding Redis caching to improve application performance.


- story: From a young age, I was interested in computers and loved exploring settings in video games. One day, I played
  against
  game developers in Tanks and won. I thought I was skilled, but I soon realized that the developers were the real
  experts. This inspired me to learn more about IT. Over time, I have developed my skills in programming, data
  management, and automation. Now I have several years of experience working with Python, databases, and large data
  systems.

**EMR / EHR:**

- **EMR (Electronic Medical Record)** — a digital version of a patient's medical history maintained by a single medical
  organization. It includes records of doctor visits, diagnoses, test results, and treatment.
- **EHR (Electronic Health Record)** — a comprehensive health record that consolidates all medical information about a
  patient from multiple sources. It can be shared between different healthcare facilities to provide integrated patient
  care.

**HealthCare Interoperability Tools:**

- Tools that ensure interaction between different healthcare systems, such as transferring data between EMR/EHR systems.

**Integration Engines:**

- **Intersystems** — a platform for integrating and managing data, often used to combine different healthcare systems.
- **Lyniate** — a data integration solution used in healthcare to ensure data compatibility and correct transfer.
- **Redox** — a platform for connecting healthcare applications to EHR systems, allowing easy data exchange between
  different healthcare facilities.
- **Mirth Connect** — an open-source integration platform that supports the exchange of healthcare data in various
  formats and standards.
- **Epic / Cerner** — major providers of EHR systems, widely used in hospitals to maintain electronic patient records
  and integrate with other systems.

**R&D (Research and Development):**

- **R&D** — the process of creating and improving products and technologies using innovative ideas and methods to drive
  business growth and competitive advantages.

**DICOM:**

- **DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine)** — a standard for storing and transmitting medical images
  and related data, supporting both static and dynamic (e.g., video) medical data from different examinations (CT, MRI,
  etc.).

**HL7 / FHIR:**

- **HL7 (Health Level Seven)** — an international standard for exchanging and integrating electronic medical
  information, defining data formats and protocols for transferring information between healthcare facilities.
- **FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources)** — a modern standard developed to simplify the exchange of
  electronic medical data, based on web technologies for faster and easier data exchange between healthcare systems.

## 3. Какие навыки вы использовали в вашем последнем проекте?
